# Pin Note

The **Pin Note** action can be found in the action panel which is accessible with the keyboard shortcut `cmd + k`. Additionally, the action can be triggered with the keyboard shortcut `alt + p` without having to open the action panel.

This action can be used to pin a note. Pinned notes will be available in the [Pinned Notes command](https://) and [Menu Bar](https://). A pinned note will have a `‚≠ê` in front of its name.

A pinned note can be unpinned with the same keyboard shortcut `alt + p` or by searching for the **Unpin Note** action in the action panel.
