# Open Note

Use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + k` to open the action panel.

There are four different actions to open a note. Every action comes with its own keyboard shortcut to trigger them. You can change the **Primary Action** in the extensions [Preferences](https://www.google.de).


### Quick Look

The **Quick Look** action will open the note in Raycast itself. It can render basic markdown syntax and external links are clickable. In **Quick Look** all actions are still available in the action panel that can be accessed with `cmd + k`.

### Open in Obsidian

The **Open in Obsidian** action will open the note in Obsidian. It will launch Obsidian when it is not active.

### Open in new Pane

The **Open in new Pane** action will open the note in a new pane in Obsidian. It uses the Obsidian community plugin [Advanced URI](https://).

:::warning Take care

Make sure the [Advanced URI plugin](https://) is installed. If the plugin is **not** installed this action will not show up.

:::

### Show in Finder

The **Show in Finder** action will reveal the note in the Finder app.
